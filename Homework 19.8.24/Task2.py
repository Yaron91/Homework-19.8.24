print("There are number of reasons why we cant use index in set:")
print("1. Sets in Python do not maintain order, which mean they do not posses permanent location, and adding or removing items, might change locations of different items.")
print("2. Sets return only unique items, adding an existing item to a set will be ignored in the output.")
print("3. For the reasons above, index is a function that is not supported in set and will result in an error.")
